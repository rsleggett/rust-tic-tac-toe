# Tic-Tac-Toe in Bevy

This project is a simple implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe using the Bevy game engine, demonstrating AI-assisted development using the Cursor IDE.

## Features
- Clean, modern UI with hover effects
- Two player gameplay (X's and O's)
- Win detection
- Victory celebration with sound
- Draw game detection

## How to Play
1. Run the game with `cargo run`
2. Players take turns clicking squares to place their pieces
3. Player 1 uses X's (red)
4. Player 2 uses O's (blue)
5. Get three in a row to win!

## Credits
Victory sound effect converted from MP3 to OGG format, originally created by [celestialghost8](https://opengameart.org/content/victory) and licensed under CC0.

## Development Process
This project started as a basic Tic-Tac-Toe implementation and was enhanced through AI-assisted development using Cursor IDE. Rather than traditional pair programming, it demonstrates how AI can assist in completing and enhancing a codebase with minimal human intervention - taking a basic board implementation and adding features like win detection, victory celebrations, and proper game state management through high-level instructions.
